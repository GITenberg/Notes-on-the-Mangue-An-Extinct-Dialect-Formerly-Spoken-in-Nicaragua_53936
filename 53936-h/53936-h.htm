<p><i>Sources.</i> Nothing whatever has been published about the
Mangue language, except a list of ninety-five words, by Mr. E.
G. Squier in his work, “Nicaragua, its People, Scenery and
Monuments.” Whence he obtained this short vocabulary he
does not state; but it is evidently the work of some one only
slightly acquainted with the character of the language. I do not
make any use of it in the present notes, except in a few instances
for comparison.</p>

<p>My authorities are, first, Don Juan Eligio de la Rocha’s
<cite>Apuntamientos de la Lengua Mangue, MS.</cite> The author was
born in Granada, C. A., June 15, 1815. By profession a lawyer,
his taste led him to the study of languages, and he acquired a
fluent knowledge of French, English and Italian. He was
appointed instructor in French and Spanish grammar in 1848
in the University of Leon, C. A., and ten years later, 1858, published
his <cite>Elementos de Gramática Castellana</cite> (Leon, 1858, small
4to, pp. 199). His death occurred in 1873.</p>

<p>While living in Masaya in 1842, he became interested in the
surviving remnants of the Mangues, and undertook to collect
materials for a study of their language. Unfortunately, he never
completed these investigations, and many of the sheets on which
he had recorded his notes were scattered. A few of them, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
were in the hands of his brother, Doctor Don Jesus de la
Rocha, of Granada, who gave Dr. C. H. Berendt an opportunity
to copy them in 1874.</p>

<p>In that same year, 1874, Dr. Berendt collected the last
obtainable fragments of the Mangue. In his (printed) lecture
before the American Geographical Society in 1876, he thus
describes his efforts in this direction, and at the same time
points out the localities where the Mangue speaking populations
were located when they first came to the knowledge of the invading
whites:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Spaniards on entering the present State of Nicaragua from Nicoya
bay, and then marching through the country, came into contact first with
the southern section of the Chorotegas or Mangues, as they were also
called; then with a Nahuatl tribe, whose capital and king are mentioned
as bearing the name of Nicarao; and after these again with Chorotegas or
Mangues, who, however, did not occupy the whole tract of land up to the
Bay of Fonseca, but were again separated from the Chorotegas on the
shores of that bay by another foreign tribe called Maribios. Thus we
obtain the three sections into which the Chorotegas of Nicaragua were
divided at the time of the Conquest. Now, their language seemed to me
an object worthy of having some special attention bestowed upon it&mdash;not
so much for its own sake, but in order that a better understanding might
be arrived at of the ethnological features of Nicaragua, which, on account
of an insufficient acquaintance with its actual condition as well as with the
early writers, and of the rather precarious speculations and conjectures of
modern authors based upon such scanty knowledge, have become greatly
confused. Having studied the Chapanecan language on a former expedition,
and wishing to compare it with the Chorotegan, I visited Nicaragua
in the year 1874. I found that the Indian population near the Nicoya and
the Fonseca bays had entirely disappeared, and in both districts only met
with some local names belonging to the Chorotegan language. In the
third district also, where descendants of the old stock are still living in
twelve villages around the lakes of Masaya and Apoyo, I was informed
that no other vestiges of the old idiom were left, the inhabitants speaking
exclusively the Spanish language. I had, however, the good luck to
ferret out some old people who still remembered words and phrases they
had heard in their childhood; and I was enabled to collect material sufficient
to convince myself and others of the identity of this Mangue or
Chorotegan idiom with the Chapaneco language of Mexico. I was not a
moment too early in obtaining this information, for the greater number of
my informants died while I was staying in the country. I still hope that
with the knowledge of the Chorotegan thus gained in Nicaragua and
Chiapas, it may be possible to trace their history and descent backwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to one of the nations that were living in Anahuac in the earliest times of
which our records speak.”</p>

</div>

<p>The materials were never published by Dr. Berendt, nor,
indeed, did the many other projects which occupied him allow
him the leisure to collate and arrange them. I have taken them
from his original notes, often in pencil and not always perfectly
legible. But I believe those here offered can be depended upon
as accurate, and have special value as the sole remaining vestiges
of an idiom now wholly extinct.</p>

<p><i>Synonyms.</i> It will be seen that Berendt speaks of this
people as the “Chorotegas or Mangues.” I have given the
origin of these names in the Introduction to “The Güegüence, a
Comedy-Ballet in the Nahuatl-Spanish Dialect of Nicaragua,”
published as Number III, of “Brinton’s Library of Aboriginal
American Literature” (Philadelphia, 1883). They adjoined on
the north-east and south-west the Nahuatl-speaking tribe, who
occupied the narrow strip of land between Lake Nicaragua and
the Pacific ocean.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They were of one blood and one language, and called themselves
<i>Mánkeme</i>, rulers, masters, which the Spaniards corrupted into <i>Mangues</i>.
The invading Aztecs appear to have split this ancient tribe into two fractions,
the one driven toward the south, about the Gulf of Nicoya, the
other northward, on and near Lake Managua, and beyond it on Fonseca
bay. Probably in memory of this victory, the Aztec Nicaraguans applied
to them the opprobrious name, <i>Chololteca</i>, ‘those driven out,’ from the
Nahuatl verb <i>choloa</i>, in its compulsive form <i>chololtia</i>, and the suffix,
<i>tecatl</i>, people; which was corrupted by the Spaniards into <i>Chorotegas</i>.”
(<cite>The Güegüence</cite>, Introduction, p. viii.)</p>

</div>

<p>In Squier’s work above referred to they are called “Chorotegans
or Dirians.” The latter is from the Mangue <i>diri</i>, a hill or
mountain, and was applied to that portion of them who dwelt in
the hilly country south of Masaya.</p>

<p>The Spanish form of their native name is that which I should
recommend for adoption in ethnological works.</p>

<p><i>Early Notices.</i> The old historians and travelers, on whom we
depend for our knowledge of Nicaragua, tell us practically
nothing about this language, and little about the people who
spoke it. The chieftain, called Nicoya, living on the bay of that
name, was first visited by Captain Gil Gonzalez Dávila in 1523.
The natives were estimated at about six thousand, who received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the Spaniards in a friendly manner, and gave them considerable
gold.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Oviedo in his <cite>Historia de las Indias</cite> gives a few words of the
language as follows:</p>

<table summary="Some words">
  <tr>
    <td><i>mamea</i>,</td>
    <td>hell.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>nam bi</i>,</td>
    <td>dog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>nam bue</i>,</td>
    <td>tiger,</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">the last two of which correspond to those in later vocabularies.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Auditor Garcia de Palacio (1576) mentions the Mangue
as spoken in Choluteca, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, in the last
mentioned as introduced from elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> About a century later
a colony of Mangues, several hundred in number, were found by
Juan Vazquez de Coronado, almost at the extreme eastern end
of Costa Rica, in the Province of Pacaca.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Those on the Pacific
Coast, about the Gulf of Nicoya, were accustomed to cross to the
ocean on the north for trading purposes, and to obtain salt.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
They appear to have been a people of moderate cultivation, and
rather extended commercial connections.</p>

<p><i>Affiliations.</i> The Mangue is the mother tongue from which
the Chapanec (or Chiapanec) of Chiapas branched off. The
separation from the ancestral tribe, and the migration from
Nicaragua to Chiapas, were distinctly remembered by the Chapanec
off-shoot when first encountered by the whites. Remesal,
in his well-known history, gives a brief but clear account of it.</p>

<p>The date of this occurrence cannot be specifically stated, but
its occasion can be readily surmised. The Mangues at one time
occupied the whole coast from the entrance of the Gulf of
Nicoya to Fonseca bay. At a period which we may locate some
time in the fourteenth century, a large colony of Aztecs descended
the coast and seized the strip between Lake Nicaragua
and the Pacific, thus splitting the Mangues in two, and driving
a large portion of them out of their homes. Some of these wanderers
remained with their relatives, but one body of them
marched north and west until they reached a lofty peak on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Rio Grande in Central Chiapas, where they constructed a formidable
fortress, and became the terror of their Nahuatl-speaking
neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>No connection has been demonstrated between the Mangue
(or Chapanec), and any other North American language,
although owing to the liberal exertions of M. Alphonse Pinart,
we have now in print and easily procurable, a grammar and a
number of texts of the Chapanec dialect.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A comparison, the partial results of which I have previously
published, proves that the differences between the Chapanec and
Mangue are slight and unimportant, and for purposes of collation
with other stocks the two may be looked upon as identical.</p>

<p>In the Introduction to “The Güegüence,” I pointed out some
singular coincidences between the Mangue and the Aymara of
Peru. Further examination of the two tongues has not added
to the list given, and has weakened the belief I entertained of
some possible connection in the past between them.</p>

<p>I take this occasion to point out an error which has crept into
several philological works, that of confounding the Mangue
with the Nagrandan of Nicaragua. Thus, Francisco Pimentel, in
his work on the languages of Mexico, falls into the capital mistake
of declaring the Chapanec of Chiapas to be allied to the
Nagrandan of Nicaragua; and to prove his assertion, gives a
list of alleged Nagrandan words, all of which belong to the
Mangue tongue!<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The same confusion marks an attempt of Mr. Hyde Clark, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
London, to bring into relation “the Masaya language of
Nicaragua with the Sioux language.” The words he quotes as
from Masaya are all from the Nagrandan of Subtiaba, near
Leon. There is really no relationship between the Nagrandan
and Mangue, and although Dr. Latham has attempted to indicate
some few analogies,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> they must be deemed quite accidental.</p>

<p>A comparison of about 125 words of the Mangue with the
Mixteca, which I find among the Berendt MSS., reveals only
about half a dozen similarities, all apparently accidental.</p>

<p><i>Phonetics.</i> The Mangue words in this paper are principally in
letters with the Spanish powers, some of the semi-vowels being
in smaller type. The <i>h</i> is pronounced as an aspirate, and is
equivalent to the <i>j</i>, which has its aspirated Spanish value.</p>

<p>All syllables are open; that is, they all end in a vowel sound.
Thus <i>nimbu</i>, water, is to be divided <i>ni-mbu</i>. In this respect it
resembles the Cherokee, the Japanese, etc.</p>

<p>Dr. Berendt stated that the Chapanec dialect was the most
difficult of any American language he had ever studied, on
account of the obscurity and uncertainty of its sounds. It is
greatly syncopated, and terminal syllables are often pronounced
in so low a tone that they escape the unpracticed ear. The
vowels are not distinct, and many of the consonants are “alternating”
as it is called, that is, one may be substituted for another
without altering the meaning of the word. Thus, evil spirit
(<i>demonio</i>) may be either <i>tixämbi´</i> or <i>sisaⁱmbᵘi</i>, these two being
the same word pronounced indifferently, either way, by the same
individual. This is by no means without parallel in American
languages.</p>

<p>The curious frequency in the Mangue of the “resonants” <i>n</i>
and <i>m</i> will strike every observer. This is also the case in the
Chapanec. Albornoz regards it as a phonetic phenomenon only,
and remarks, “Whenever a word begins with <i>b</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>y</i> or <i>d</i>, an <i>n</i>
must be written before it, which is pronounced with the word
itself.” Dr. Berendt calls it an “article” which appears as <i>n</i>,
<i>na</i>, <i>ni</i>, or <i>m</i>, especially before the letter <i>b</i>. As such, I may
suggest its similarity to the Nahuatl <i>in</i>, and the Othomi <i>na</i>, both
of which are demonstratives worn down almost to articles.</p>

<p>There is a similar resonant nasal in various South American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
tongues, especially the Tupi-Guarani dialects of Brazil. It
appears most frequently before the consonants <i>b</i> and <i>d</i>. Its
peculiarity is that it is not an expiratory sound, but a soft <i>inspirate</i>,
and as such is claimed by Dr. Nogueira to be a phonetic
phenomenon confined exclusively to American tongues.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I have
been unable to decide from the descriptions within my reach of
the Chapanec phonetics, whether the initial resonant is an inspirate,
and I would call the attention of travelers to this interesting
point.</p>

<p>In addition to this simple resonant prefix there are a number
of particles beginning either with <i>n</i> or <i>m</i>, which are added to
indicate the absolute or independent form of the noun, that is,
to characterize it when not attached to a personal possessive
pronoun. Of these Albornoz gives fourteen for the singular, and
seven for the plural. This will explain the striking prevalence
of words beginning with these letters in the vocabulary.</p>

<p>Accent is of the utmost importance in both these dialects, and
the identity to the eye of various words as <i>nyujmi</i>, ear and
smoke, arises from absence of proper accent marks in my
authorities. The words for bird, snake and flower are the same;
but Albornoz gives this very example to illustrate the importance
of accent, <i>nolō</i>, a snake, <i>nolô</i>, a flower. Unfortunately,
none of my authorities employ any accentual mark but the acute,
and this appears to be syllabic. A vowel written above the line
of the word, in Berendt’s MSS., signifies a semi-vowel.</p>

<p><i>Structure.</i> The general structure of the Mangue was clearly
polysynthetic and incorporative in a marked degree. In its
grammar it was no doubt identical in all essential points with
the Chapanec, about which, as above mentioned, we have considerable
information in published sources. Nominal and verbal
forms are defined by the categories of animate and inanimate
genera, a distinction which is to a certain extent purely grammatical,
as for instance, a book is considered animate, and a table
inanimate (Albornoz, <cite>Gram.</cite>, cap. xiii). The first person plural
has an inclusive and exclusive form. Adjectives usually, but
not always, follow the nouns. Plurals are frequently formed
by simply lengthening the terminal vowel sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Vocabulary.</i> The words in the vocabulary have been
obtained from the Rocha and Berendt MSS. Where these two
authorities differ the variants are indicated by the affixed
initials, R. and B. All words quoted for the sake of comparison
from Squier, are marked by an affixed S. The observations,
explanations and other remarks attached to the words
and phrases are my own. The comparative expressions taken
from the Chapanec (marked, <i>Chap.</i>) are from the printed works
above mentioned, or from MS. vocabularies of various authorship
in my possession.</p>

<p>All of Rocha’s words are from the dialect of Masaya; but Dr.
Berendt obtained some at the villages of Masatepec, Niquindomo,
and Namotiva´, and this explains the occasional variants
given. The differences, however, between the speech of these
localities was evidently slight.</p>

<h2><i>Observations on the Vocabulary.</i></h2>

<p><i>Prefixes.</i>&mdash;The most frequent prefixes in the vocabulary are
<i>nyu</i> and <i>nya</i>. They probably indicate the position of the noun
as independent of expressed possessive relations. In the Chapanec
they are also found, but not so commonly. They do not
appear to be classificatory particles, as they are prefixed to the
names of the most diverse objects.</p>

<p><i>Generic Names.</i>&mdash;These are quite common, as is frequently
the case in American languages, in spite of what has often been
said to the contrary. The word <i>nyu-mbu</i> means any large quadruped;
<i>nyuⁱ</i>, any insect; <i>narimu</i>, any kind of wild fruit, etc. It
must be remembered that the genera into which individuals are
grouped have a widely different connotation from those to which
we are accustomed.</p>

<p><i>Cat.</i>&mdash;The word for cat, <i>misa</i>, seems identical with the Cakchiquel
<i>mez</i>. In Chapanec it is <i>kitu</i>, reminding one of <i>kitten</i>.
As the domestic cat was unknown in America before the discovery,
these words can probably be traced to some European
source.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Color Names.</i>&mdash;The color names appear difficult to analyze,
and vary from those in Chapanec. Thus, as given by the various
authorities, they are:</p>

<table summary="Comparison of color names between the languages">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Mangue,</th>
    <th>Chapanec.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Black,</td>
    <td>nanzome, R.</td>
    <td>dujamä.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>White,</td>
    <td>nandirime, R.</td>
    <td>dilimä.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Yellow,</td>
    <td>nandiume, R.</td>
    <td>nandikumä.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2" class="valign"><span class="by-bracket">Blue or Green,</span> <span class="bracket">{</span></td>
    <td>nandipame, R.</td>
    <td rowspan="2" class="valign">ndipamä.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>apame, B.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Red,</td>
    <td>arimbome, B.</td>
    <td>nduimä.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In these adjectives the termination <i>me</i> or <i>mä</i> does not belong
to the root. Father Abornoz tells us that this suffix characterizes
adjectives in the singular number, when they qualify a certain
class of nouns “in <i>tighe</i>.” (See his <cite>Gram.</cite> p. 15.) The
nasal or resonant beginning most of them is also a mere prefix.</p>

<p><i>Proper Names.</i>&mdash;But few native families of the Mangue districts
of Nicaragua have retained names drawn from their
ancient tongues. In a list before me of several hundred persons
in Masaya and Managua, the only surnames from the Mangue
are <i>Norori</i>, <i>Ñamendi</i>, <i>Namullure</i>, <i>Putoi</i>, <i>Nionongue</i>, <i>Macanche</i>,
and perhaps <i>Huembes</i> and <i>Piura</i>. Generally, the natives adopted
Spanish surnames.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a large number of local names, derived
from the Mangue language, on the map of Nicaragua still define
the region once occupied by this nation. Such are <i>Nindiria</i>
(from <i>ninda</i>, shore, <i>diri</i>, hill), <i>Nakutiri</i> (from <i>naku</i>, fire, <i>diri</i>,
hill), <i>Monimbe</i> (<i>nimbu</i>, water, rain), <i>Nandasimo</i> (<i>nanda</i>, brook),
Mombonasi (<i>nasi</i>, woman), <i>Masaya</i>, <i>Managua</i>, <i>Namotiva</i>, <i>Norome</i>,
<i>Nicoya</i>, <i>Oretina</i>, etc., etc.</p>

Dr. Berendt states that the natives pronounce the name of the province

sacred bird, the Ara or Guacamayo, from which they named their fortress in the
State of Chiapas. Father Juan Nuñez, who was missionary among them about
1620, and who preached and wrote in their tongue, also called it “la lengua

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
